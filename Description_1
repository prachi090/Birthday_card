This is my first project using Aedo Aero, a simple yet interactive birthday card application.
The project includes basic features such as animations, text effects, and a visually appealing layout to create a delightful greeting experience.

This project helped me explore the fundamentals of Aedo Aero while learning how to implement interactive UI elements. 
More features and enhancements may be added in future updates!
